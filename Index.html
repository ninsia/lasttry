<p>What does color mean?<br><br>
Color is your brain's interpretation of the signals your eyes give off when light enters. That's
why you don't see colors when it's dark. In fact, we can only detect red, green, and blue light
with the rods and cones in our eyes.</p></div><br>
<button>Red, green, blue are the basic additive colors.</button><br><br>
